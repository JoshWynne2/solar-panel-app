# Solimeter
A solar panel monitoring app

There are currently debug buttons on to simulate solar panel features,

Dashboard: simulates a whole day of solar panel usage, saves all data to the user's json file
Alarm: creates an alarm item for your user

## How user data works:
When a user account is created it makes a json file with the user id as the filename
When your solar panel sends data it will update your json file (emulate with the debug button)
